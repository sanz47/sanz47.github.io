            <h1>About Me</h1>
            When I was a boy of 13, I became captivated by the voice assistant Siri on iOS, which sparked my interest in technology. My curiosity led me to ask questions about how it worked, and I discovered that artificial intelligence and machine learning were the key technologies behind it. From that moment, I knew I wanted to do something equally incredible in the field of AI. As I became interested in
this field, I began to study these technologies more deeply, I became increasingly fascinated by
their potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. My dream is to contribute
to the development of revolutionary AI systems that can enhance human capabilities and improve our quality of life. In the near future, I see myself as a researcher in the field of artificial
intelligence.
<br>

I knew it would be a challenging journey to become a computer engineer. However, I was
committed to making it happen. My first step towards achieving this goal was to get admitted
into a reputable engineering program. After researching various institutions and programs,
I decided to apply to the engineering program at the Islamic University of Technology(IUT)
which is one of the best universities in Bangladesh. The application process was rigorous, and
I had to work hard to prepare all the necessary documents and study for the admission exam.
But I was determined to succeed, and I put in all my effort. I was overjoyed when I heard
that I was given an opportunity to be admitted to the department of Computer Science and
Engineering. This was the first step towards achieving my dream of becoming an engineer.
IUT provided me with the perfect field to nurture and enhance my knowledge and gave me the
chance to work on various projects and experiments.

<br>
As I have developed a strong passion for the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, I have already completed various courses on these topics which have provided me
with a solid foundation in the underlying concepts and algorithms. Additionally, I have also
gained practical experience through participating in competitions on Kaggle. I believe that my
background in machine learning and artificial intelligence, along with my experience in Kaggle
competitions, have prepared me well for the upcoming chapters of my life. I am hopeful about
the opportunity to learn from leading experts in the field.
